## Computer User Basics
A website providing high-level and simplified explanations on all things computer.

Concepts will range from hardware to software to computer networking to cloud computing... and much more !

As a computer engineering student, I have been amazed by how far the world of computing truly expands to. During my 3 years of education,
I have learned more about computers than I ever could have imagined when first entering university.
However, at times I have also found myself overwhelmed by the vast and seemingly endless amount of information there still is to learn.
So, this website is to remind myself, as well as anyone who may fall upon it, that the fundamental concepts behind computer engineering
are intriguing, learnable, and not something to be feared. 

My goal is to continue expanding on this website as I continue to broaden my knowledge on this wonderful little thing called a "computer".
